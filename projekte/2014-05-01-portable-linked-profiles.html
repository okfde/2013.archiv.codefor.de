PLP proposes a pattern for the creation, storage, listing and representation of
public profile data for people, groups, organizations, venues and a large
etcetera.

Based on Open Web Standards, Common Vocabularies and Open Source
technologies, it offers users the possibility to own the their data diverging
from current mainstream and centralized profile platforms.
