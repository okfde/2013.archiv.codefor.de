Thirteen events were hosted across Germany for the fifth annual Open Data Day.

Leipzig, Münster, Berlin, Munich, Cologne, Wuppertal, Hamburg, Heilbronn (in Mannheim) and Ulm all participated. Frankfurt, Jena, Magdeburg und Karlsruhe used Open Data Day as an opportunity to launch new OK Labs!

Designers, coders, journalists, city planners, city authorities, and local politicians all came together to support further open data adoption in Germany. They hacked, coded, discussed, and welcomed new members to the community. Here's a overview of what took place at various events last Saturday:
