CodeforPB, the OK Lab in Paderborn, is a loose group of technophiles who want to use their skills "for the sake of society." The aim is to develop applications and visualizations for the city.

We meet every two weeks on Wednesday evenings at the C3PB office (Westernmauer 12-16). Those interested are encouraged to come by one of our meetings and/or sign up for our mailing list.
