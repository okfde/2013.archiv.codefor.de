Welcome to the Berlin OK Lab! We are about 30 people working in various groups on projects around open data and civic tech. We all come from different areas, so the projects we work on are very diverse.

We meet every Monday at 19.00 (usually at WikiBär, Köpenicker Straße 45) to work on our projects. On the 2nd Monday every month, we also host an open round (usually at Wikimedia, Tempelhofer Ufer 23 - please double check with Meetup) to show participants our previous projects and present new ideas and projects that can be contributed to. If this has sparked your interest, feel free to swing by one of our intro meetings.
